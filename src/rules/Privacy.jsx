        In addition, we may track your behavior, preferences, and other information that you choose to provide on our Platform. This data is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. We also collect information related to your transactions on the Platform as well as on third-party partner platforms. When a third-party business partner collects your personal data directly from you, you will be governed by their privacy policies. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such third-party policies, and we encourage you to review them before disclosing your information.

If you have already disclosed such information, report it immediately to the appropriate law enforcement agency.

        We use your personal data to provide the services you request. This includes assisting sellers and business partners with order processing, enhancing customer experience, resolving disputes, troubleshooting issues, and informing you about online and offline offers, products, services, and updates.

      <h2>Sharing</h2>
      <p>
        We may share your personal data internally within our group entities, other corporate entities, and affiliates to provide you access to the services and products they offer. These entities may also market to you as a result of such sharing unless you explicitly opt out. We may disclose your personal data to third parties—including sellers, business partners, logistics partners, payment providers, prepaid payment instrument issuers, third-party reward programs, and other service providers—as necessary to provide you access to our services, comply with legal obligations, enforce our user agreements, facilitate marketing activities, or prevent, detect, mitigate, and investigate fraudulent or illegal activities.

      <p>
        We may also disclose personal and sensitive data to government or authorized law enforcement agencies if required by law, or if we believe such disclosure is necessary to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal processes, to enforce our Terms of Use or Privacy Policy, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of our users or the public.
      </p>

      <h2>Security Precautions</h2>

        To protect your personal data from unauthorized access, disclosure, loss, or misuse, we employ reasonable security practices and procedures, including the use of secure servers and strict security guidelines when you access your account. However, please note that data transmission over the internet and the World Wide Web is not completely secure, and there are inherent risks associated with online data transfer.
